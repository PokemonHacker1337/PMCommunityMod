3. Using git, discard changes for the repo in case copying vanilla assets has overwritten any of the mod assets.
4. Create your own fork of the repo.
5. Make your changes to the mod.
6. If your changes have overwritten a vanilla asset, force add them to the repo.

# Rules for contributing
- Your contribution must not break any rule of the Paper Mario Modding server.
- Your contribution may not overwrite the work of another person without express permission of the original person.
- Your contribution must be able to compile, and not unavoidably crash the game.
- Your contribution must keep the game in a somewhat vanilla structure. new maps are okay, but they must be functionally the same as the map they are replacing.
